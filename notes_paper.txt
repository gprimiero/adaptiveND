prove 

\vdash A\rightarrow (B \rightarrow \bot) implies (A \wedge B) \rightarrow \bot

to show commutativity and associativity of \neg
(Weak contrapposition)

(absorption of negation): contraction

(we drop negative ex falso)

(N holds)


we need to add a justification for a negation operator in AdaptiveND determined by the adaptive reasoning to deal with abonormalities

rephrase \Omega

then MinimalND is CLUN [reference]
