  abstract = {In the service of paraconsistent (indeed, âdialetheicâ) theories, Graham Priest has long advanced a non-monotonic logic (viz., MiLP) as our âuniversal logicâ (at least for standard connectives), one that enjoys the familiar logic LP (for âlogic of paradoxâ) as its monotonic core (Priest, G. In Contradiction, 2nd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press. First printed by Martinus Nijhoff in 1987: Chs. 16 and 19). In this article, I show that MiLP faces a dilemma: either it is (plainly) unsuitable as a universal logic or its role as a âuniversal logicâ (indeed, its role full stop) is a mystery. While familiarity with the basic ideas of dialetheism is assumed, formal details of the target logics are relegated to an appendix; the basic problem is evident without them.}

  title = {A Logical Approach to the Analysis of Metaphors},

	we analyze metaphors. Metaphors are powerful tools to generate new
	scientific ideas. Therefore, it is important to have a good theory
	on what metaphors are and how they function. The first question we
	have to answer when we want to develop such a theory is obviously
	``what metaphors are``. Philosophy of language can offer some interesting
	ideas but most views do not allow for a cognitive function of metaphors.
	One of the sparse views that does allow for it is interactionism.
	The basic version, however, has some serious shortcomings that need
	solving when we want to use this theory. First of all the terminology
	is too vague. Furthermore, the description of the reasoning process
	we use when we analyze a metaphor, only works for very simple examples.
	The logic I will present, <b>ALM</b>, is based on a broadened version
	of this view. A logical approach of metaphors allows us to gain a
	profound insight in the way we analyze metaphors. The analysis of
	metaphors is a dynamical reasoning process. When we want to capture
	this process in a logical system, we need a logic that is capable
	of grasping that specific type of dynamics. An adaptive logic seems
	to be the best choice. Therefore, I shall present an adaptive logic
	that grasps the analysis of metaphors.},

	must be able to model interactive computation. We show that first-order
	logic cannot model interactive computation due to the incompleteness
	of interaction. We show that interactive computation is necessarily
	paraconsistent, able to model both a fact and its negation, due to
	the role of the world (environment) in determining the course of
	the computation. We conclude that paraconsistency is a necessary
	property for a logic that can model interactive computation.},

	advantages of this reconstruction are important: the resulting logics
	have a proper theory (that leads to justified conclusions even for
	undecidable fragments), they nicely integrate deductive and abductive
	steps, and they are much closer to natural reasoning than the existing
	systems.<BR> We present two new adaptive logics for abduction, <B>CP1</B>
	and <B>CP2</B>. <B>CP1</B> enables one to generate explanations for
	novel facts from a consistent theory. <B>CP2</B> moreover enables
	one to abduce explanatory hypotheses for novel facts and for anomalous
	facts from a possibly inconsistent theory. We illustrate both logics
	with some examples from the history of the sciences (the discovery
	of Uranus and of Neptune), and present some alternatives to <B>CP1</B>
	and <B>CP2</B> that are better suited for non-creative forms of abductive

	in common thought. This assumption results in the fact that people
	usually do not make any distinction between 'the object a' and 'the
	object a at a given moment'. This laziness causes many inconsistencies.
	Several attempts to solve these inconsistencies are studied, and
	the most natural one is elaborated, namely the one obtained by applying
	Classical Logic to an ontological correct domain. This solution has
	a drawback with respect to communication, which is solved by the
	change-adaptive logic <B>CAL2</B>. This non-monotonic, paraconsistent
	logic, belongs to the family of ambiguity-adaptive logics. It has
	the special characteristic that it solves inconsistencies by the
	introduction of more precise names for objects, more exactly names
	that refer to objects at a moment. The dynamics of the logic captures
	the change in objects. <B>CAL2</B> has a nice proof theory, and an
	intuitive semantics. Interesting results and applications are commented
	upon, for instance those making use of the notion 'periods of invariance'.
	Of course, the philosophical background is discussed.},

An important property of the adaptive logics ACLuN1, ACLuN2, ACLuNs1, and ACLuNs2 logics is proved: whenever a model is not selected, this is justified in terms of a selected model (Strong Reassurance). The property fails for Priestâs LPm because its way of measuring the degree of abnormality of a model is incoherent â correcting this delivers the property.}

	<I>D</I> are the translations of the original premisses and the conclusion
	respectively from <B>L</B> into <B>CL</B>. This method simplifies
	the use of automated deduction for non-classical logics, since the
	framework for these logics can be put ``on top of'' any existing
	resolution method for classical logic. This theoretical framework
	has been implemented in a computer program. The URL where this program
	is available will be given. This approach, moreover, makes it easier
	to compare the derivability of well formed formulas from sets of
	premisses between the implemented range of logics. The resulting
	computer program can thus be seen as an useful tool for research
	in logics.},

  abstract = {In his theory of explanation Hempel introduced two basic types of
	covering law explanations for particular events: deductive-nomological
	and inductive-statistical. In this article we argue that there is
	more than one reason why adaptive logics provide the right tools
	for analyzing the argument patterns involved in these covering law
	explanations. To this end we claim that in the case of inconsistent
	knowledge systems, neither classical logic, nor a paraconsistent
	logic suffice to capture the right class of permissible arguments
	that can make up a deductive-nomological explanation, whereas an
	adaptive logic gives just the right results. The arguments behind
	inductive-statistical explanations face the well-known problem of
	inductive ambiguities, which Hempel tried to solve by his requirement
	of maximal specifity. We show how this requirement can be nicely
	incorporated in a logic for these arguments, again using an adaptive
	logic (which we describe in some detail).},
