We thank both reviewers for useful and detailed comments. The present version is largely and groundly revised in their light. In particular, we have now extended the calculus to include both marking strategies and provided a more compelling presentation of soundness and completeness. We address below each comment individually.

REVIEWER1 __ COMMENTS


The philosophical point is that in the abstract the authors advertise that the specific features of the system will be used to reconsider the question of classical recapture. However, the topic comes up only in a section titled "Concluding remarks" and is treated somewhat hastily. In particular, it's not clear to what extent the specific features of the formulation of the adaptive logic developed by the authors contribute to the development of the discussion, and to what extent what's important is just the features that adaptive logics simply have, independently of the specific features of the proof system that the authors presented. (Having said this, the formulation the authors gave is very neat and valuable independently of whether it moves the philosophical discussion forward.) Please consider being more explicit and careful about these things.



TO DO

p.  2
the line (4)  ->   line (4)


DONE

--
p. 4
Consider adding a brief gloss on the semicolon right after Definition 2. Otherwise, its role becomes clear only quite a bit later.

DONE


--
p. 8
Similar point for "finally derived".


DONE


--
p. 8
The sentence starting with "In the Adaptive trandition..." is not grammatically correct. The subject is in plural the predicate is singular.


DONE



--
p. 9
In RU2, why is it important that in the premises we have s and s+1 (and s+2) in the premises? Is it required that they be introduced exactly in this order? Wouldn't it be better to have s, s' (and s'')?


FIXED




--
p. 10
The same point for  Figure 8.


IN THIS CASE, WE KEPT THE NUMBERING AS IT WAS, AS FIGURE 8 REPRESENTS AN INSTANCE OF A PROOF. oF COURSE, THE PREMISES COULD HAVE BEEN DERIVED IN A DIFFERENT ORDER.



--
p. 10
You also used $\Omega$-form but didn't mention this. Is this intentional?


ADDED BRIEF CLARIFICATION


--
p. 18
You talk about LP+ but don't say what it is.


THIS HAS BEEN CLARIFIED THROUGH A NEW SENTENCE TO INTRODUCE (LP/CPL)


--
p. 18 "these same options" - the English here looks awkward.


FIXED

--
p. 18 In general I would re-write the sentence  "Indeed, whereas...place", it looks unclear and confusing.


REPHRASED

REVIEWER2 __ COMMENTS



1. This revised version largely extends the previous one by presenting a ND system which works for BOTH Reliability and Minimal Abnoramlity. We remained contrained *in the presentation* to a CLuN equivalent system for matters of simplicity, but the system in itself is now general enough to be considered equivalent to it.




2. The revision provides a full meta-proof of soundness/completeness wrt CLuN, see Theorem 3 and the preparatory work to that result.



3. We did not follow the suggestion of the reviewer on this point. This is a typical clash of traditions between semantic and proof-theoretic approaches. In the latter, it is standard to define formulas and their contexts inductively, without these rule being directly used in the proofs.


4. We revised according to the reviewer's comment: min is an annotation and it has been added where necessary to the examples.



5. The reformulation of Section 3 shows now how MinDab is essential to be able to derive formulas which are premises of either UnRel or Choice. In turn, these are used in the new examples.  All these rules are now clearly relativised to proof stage. The new example illustrates also how marking and unmarking can follow each other.



6.\Gamma' and \Delta' are just notations for different sets, nothing special from a formal viewpoint



7. RC has been reformulated with a an adaptive conditions set.


8. We have changed the notation.

9. FIXED

10.

11. We have rephrased the passage, but in this new formulation it is essential to present also the used notation for choice sets. In all occurrences, the standard definition of this marking procedure is fully quoted in footnote 2 now.

12. removed/fixed terminology

13. It is a member of the premise set

14. It has been fixed in the new formulation
