================================

1. Stages in RU (Figure 7) are corrected.
2. Conditions in Figure 7 are now sets of negated abnormalities.
3. "Family of sets" replaced by "set of sets".
4. The redundancy of RU is now explained as the possibility to rewrite a proof with RU as a proof without by pushing the applications of RC downwards in the proof.
5. Reformulated explanation about $\Delta$ and $\Delta^{min}$ (removed reference to disjunctions).
6. The choice of "some" in definition 5 is intended. What is derived is a set of unreliable formulae, but without the requirement that all minimal disjunction of abnormalities have been taken into account. The only requirement is that all disjunctions of abnormalities that are used to derive a set of unreliable formulas are indeed minimal at that stage. As such, $\Cup\Delta(\Gamma)$ is only a subset of the unreliable formulae as understood in the standard format. 
7.
